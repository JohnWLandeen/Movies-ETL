# Movies-ETL

## Overview

In this Extract, Transform, and Load challenge we create a function to take in three pieces of data being wikipedia-movies.json, ratings.csv, and movies_metadata.csv. We make several changes to this function such as merging and filtering columns through several jupyter notebook iterations. We finally export the merged movie_df and ratings csv to the ETL database in postgresql for further utilization.
